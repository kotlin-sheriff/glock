# Glock

Virtual glock to shoot each other in chat during discussions.

## Usage

Just add [@glockkobot](https://glockkobot.t.me) to your chat and use the `/shoot` command to shoot your buddies.

Logging into the game is done by trying to shoot someone else's message, from this point you can be banned (and you can ban other players).

If you are not logged in, then you cannot be shot.
